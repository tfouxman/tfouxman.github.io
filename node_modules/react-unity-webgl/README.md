When building content for the web, you might need to communicate with elements on a webpage. Or you might want to implement functionality using Web APIs which Unity does not currently expose by default. In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browserâ€™s JavaScript engine. React Unity WebGL provides an easy solution for embedding Unity WebGL builds in your React application, with two-way communication between your React and Unity application with advanced API's.

# Installation

Install using npm for your JavaScript (babel) and TypeScript React Project. Make sure you download the release matching with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. For the corresponding, check the releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/releases) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-unity-webgl).

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl
```

# Usage

To get started import the Unity and Unity Content class from the React Unity WebGL library. Create a new content object and assign it in your render function. For further intructions please head to the [documentation](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki) or go straight to the [quick start guide](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide). Have fun coding!

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Unity, { UnityContent } from "react-unity-webgl";

const unityContent = new UnityContent(
  "MyGame/Build.json",
  "MyGame/UnityLoader.js"

const App = () => {
  return <Unity unityContent={unityContent} />;
